# Core Module

This module contains the core business logic and engine functionality of the LangGraph framework.

## Directory Structure

- `engine/`: Core engine implementation for graph execution
- `graph/`: Graph-related functionality and data structures
- `state/`: State management and persistence
- `workflow/`: Workflow definitions and execution

## Key Components

1. **Engine**
   - Graph execution engine
   - Node processing
   - Edge traversal
   - State management

2. **Graph**
   - Graph data structures
   - Node definitions
   - Edge definitions
   - Graph validation

3. **State**
   - State persistence
   - State transitions
   - State validation

4. **Workflow**
   - Workflow definitions
   - Workflow execution
   - Workflow validation

## Usage

```python
from langgraph.core.engine import GraphEngine
from langgraph.core.graph import Graph, Node, Edge
from langgraph.core.state import State
from langgraph.core.workflow import Workflow

# Create a graph
graph = Graph()
graph.add_node(Node("input"))
graph.add_node(Node("process"))
graph.add_edge(Edge("input", "process"))

# Create a workflow
workflow = Workflow(graph)

# Execute the workflow
engine = GraphEngine()
result = engine.execute(workflow)
```

## Best Practices

- Keep core logic pure and stateless where possible
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use type hints for better code clarity
- Document all public interfaces
- Write comprehensive tests for core functionality
