# NeuralFlow System Flows Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation for all main and sub flows in the NeuralFlow system. Each flow is documented with its purpose, components, and interactions.

## Flow Categories

1. [Core Workflow Flows](core-workflows/README.md)
   - Main application workflow
   - Task orchestration
   - Error handling and recovery

2. [LLM Integration Flows](llm-integration/README.md)
   - Model interaction
   - Prompt management
   - Response processing

3. [Vector Store Flows](vector-store/README.md)
   - Document processing
   - Embedding generation
   - Similarity search
   - Index management

4. [Memory Management Flows](memory-management/README.md)
   - Context tracking
   - State management
   - Memory optimization

5. [Graph Processing Flows](graph-processing/README.md)
   - Knowledge graph operations
   - Relationship mapping
   - Graph traversal

6. [Integration Flows](integration/README.md)
   - LLM-Vector store integration
   - Memory-Graph integration
   - External API integration

## Flow Documentation Structure

Each flow documentation includes:

- **Purpose**: Clear description of the flow's objective
- **Components**: Main components and their roles
- **Flow Diagram**: Visual representation of the flow
- **Sequence**: Step-by-step execution sequence
- **Configuration**: Required configuration parameters
- **Error Handling**: Error scenarios and recovery procedures
- **Examples**: Usage examples and sample implementations

## Best Practices

When working with these flows:

1. **Configuration Validation**
   - Always validate flow configurations before execution
   - Use provided validation utilities

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling at each step
   - Follow the documented recovery procedures

3. **Monitoring**
   - Use the built-in monitoring capabilities
   - Track flow performance metrics

4. **Testing**
   - Test flows in isolation
   - Validate integration points

## Flow Development Guidelines

When developing new flows or modifying existing ones:

1. **Documentation**
   - Update flow documentation
   - Include clear examples
   - Document configuration parameters

2. **Testing**
   - Add unit tests
   - Include integration tests
   - Update test documentation

3. **Performance**
   - Consider resource usage
   - Implement proper caching
   - Optimize critical paths

4. **Security**
   - Follow security best practices
   - Validate inputs
   - Handle sensitive data properly

## Contributing

When contributing new flows or modifications:

1. Follow the established documentation structure
2. Include all required sections
3. Update relevant diagrams
4. Add comprehensive examples
5. Update the main README.md

## Version Control

Flow documentation is version controlled along with the code. Major changes to flows should be:

1. Documented in CHANGELOG.md
2. Tagged with appropriate version
3. Reviewed by team members
4. Tested thoroughly before deployment
