    participant Client
    participant API
    participant WorkflowEngine
    participant LLMService
    participant VectorStore
    participant MemoryService

    Client->>API: Submit Query
    API->>WorkflowEngine: Initialize Workflow
    WorkflowEngine->>MemoryService: Fetch Context
    WorkflowEngine->>VectorStore: Search Relevant Data
    VectorStore-->>WorkflowEngine: Return Matches
    WorkflowEngine->>LLMService: Process Query with Context
    LLMService-->>WorkflowEngine: Return Response
    WorkflowEngine->>MemoryService: Update Memory
    WorkflowEngine-->>API: Return Results
    API-->>Client: Deliver Response
```

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- CPU: 4+ cores recommended
- RAM: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended
- Storage: SSD with 20GB+ free space

### Software Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Redis 6.0 or higher
- Docker 20.10 or higher
- CUDA 11.0+ (for GPU support)
