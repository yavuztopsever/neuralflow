# NeuralFlow Architecture

## System Overview

NeuralFlow is built on a modular, event-driven architecture that enables flexible and scalable AI workflow management. The system is designed to handle complex AI operations while maintaining high performance and reliability.

## Core Components

### 1. Core Engine

The core engine (`src/core/`) is the heart of NeuralFlow, consisting of:
- Workflow engine (`workflow/`)
- State management (`state/`)
- Graph processing (`graph/`)
- Context management (`context/`)
- Event system (`events/`)
- Tool management (`tools/`)
- Service layer (`services/`)

```mermaid

    A[Core Engine] --> B[Workflow Engine]
    A --> C[State Manager]
    A --> D[Graph Processor]
    A --> E[Context Manager]
    A --> F[Event System]
    A --> G[Tool Manager]
    A --> H[Service Layer]
```

### 2. Data Management

The data management system includes:
- Vector store (`src/vector_store/`)
- Graph store (`src/graph_store/`)
- Memory system (`src/memory/`)
- Storage system (`src/storage/`)
- Data processing (`src/data/`)

### 3. Infrastructure

The infrastructure layer (`src/infrastructure/`) provides:
- Configuration management
- Logging system
- Monitoring
- Deployment tools

### 4. UI Layer

The UI layer (`src/ui/`) provides:
- User interface components
- Visualization tools
- Interactive workflow builder

### 5. API Layer

The API layer (`src/api/`) provides:
- RESTful endpoints
- WebSocket support
- Authentication
- Rate limiting

    Client->>UI/API: Request
    UI/API->>Core: Process Request
    Core->>Data: Process Data
    Data->>Storage: Store/Retrieve
    Storage-->>Data: Data
    Data-->>Core: Processed Data
    Core-->>UI/API: Result
    UI/API-->>Client: Response
```
