## Architecture Overview

NeuralFlow implements a sophisticated graph-based workflow system with the following key architectural components:

### 1. Graph Workflow System
- **Nodes**: Processing units for specific tasks
- **Edges**: Connections defining data flow
- **Workflows**: Orchestration of nodes and edges
- **Execution Engine**: Workflow execution and management

### 2. Memory Management System
- **Short-term Memory**: Recent context and session data
- **Mid-term Memory**: Session-level information
- **Long-term Memory**: Historical data and knowledge
- **Vector Storage**: Semantic search capabilities

### 3. Context Management System
- **Context Aggregation**: Gathering context from multiple sources
- **Context Processing**: Processing and filtering context
- **Context Storage**: Storing and retrieving context
- **Context Optimization**: Optimizing context for processing

### 4. Response Generation System
- **Response Assembly**: Building responses from components
- **Style Management**: Managing response style and format
- **Quality Control**: Ensuring response quality
- **Delivery System**: Response delivery and formatting
