## Key Components

### Data Ingestion Module
- **Data Science Pipeline**: Orchestrates data preparation, model training, evaluation, and deployment
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality and consistency
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhances training data through various techniques
- **Workflow Nodes**: Implements training and processing nodes

### Training Module
- **Model Training**: Handles model training and fine-tuning
- **Evaluation**: Provides comprehensive model evaluation
- **Deployment**: Manages model versioning and deployment
- **Monitoring**: Tracks training progress and metrics

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neuralflow.git
cd neuralflow
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

1. Initialize the data science pipeline:
```python
from core.data_ingestion.training import DataSciencePipeline

pipeline = DataSciencePipeline(
    output_dir="training_output",
    n_splits=5,
    random_state=42
)
```

2. Run the pipeline:
```python
results = pipeline.run_pipeline(
    data=your_data,
    model_type="all"
)
```

3. Access results:
```python
print(results["metrics"])
print(results["visualizations"])
```
